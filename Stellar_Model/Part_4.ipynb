    "The final step in making our stellar model will call upon the functions we have already written to set up the initial values and carry out the integrations from the centre and surface of the star to the meeting point at $\\frac{2}{3}M_{tot}$.

We then run the integrations to the meeting point and see how much the mismatches change.
